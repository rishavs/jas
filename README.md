# JAS (Just Add Sugar!) Web Framework
The â€œJust Add Sugar" framework is a simple web framework built on top of just-js

Note: This is a a project which was just started and is still in ideation phase.

JAS has the following key aspects;
1. Built on top of just-js
2. Tries to match Express.js api
3. First class support for Typescript
4. Full compatibility with express middlewares and other key libraries
5. Compatibility with some select nodejs libraries
6. Package, dependency management and running/build using npm
7. Basic project template using npx
8. Provides 2 deployment paths - docker, single binary

Goals:
1:1 api parity with express
a user should be able to use any reasonable Express project and just use it in JAS without any code changes and enjoy the masive speed/load bearing improvements.
